# WebhookEvent

The body of every webhook delivery: {id, type, created_at, data}, where type chooses the shape of data. Deliveries are at least once and unordered: deduplicate on id, and keep an assessment only when its detail.assessment_version is newer than the one you hold. GET /v1/assessments/{assessment_id} stays authoritative.
