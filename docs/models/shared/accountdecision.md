# AccountDecision

block when the score reached your block threshold (risk.block of the assessment), otherwise the assessment's recommendation. held only for a flow whose admission is held (settings flows.<flow>.admission), when the account's current assessment was made for that flow and its investigation has not completed (status partial): the final decision arrives as account.risk_changed when the investigation completes, decided by its score, or when the hold's deadline (hold_seconds after the assessment was created) passes first, as the flow's on_expiry action or the decision the evidence so far gives, whichever is stricter. Your application applies it.

## Example Usage

```ruby
require "noresponse"

value = AccountDecision::ALLOW

# Open enum: use .deserialize() to create instances from custom string values
custom = AccountDecision.deserialize("custom_value")
```
